# Meta-Circular Evaluator by using lambda with lexical scope

This Scheme code is a Meta-Circular Evaluator, JUST by using the following special forms and builtin functions, **without *define* special form**.

* Special forms: `lambda` with lexical scope, `quote`, `cond`
* Builtin functions: `car`, `cdr`, `cons`, `eq?`, `pair?`

U combinators are mainly used to implement the Eval, Apply and other utilities.
